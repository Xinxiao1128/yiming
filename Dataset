The dataset contains 38 categories and consists of about 87K images of healthy and diseased crop leaves. The entire dataset was divided into training and validation sets in the ratio of 80/20 and the catalogue structure was retained. Subsequently a new catalogue containing 33 test images was created for prediction purpose.
